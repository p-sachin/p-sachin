### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Sachin Pokharel!


Iâ€™m an AI engineer experienced in python, across a wide field of interests. Especially on data analysis, data visualization, core machine learning (regressions, classification, etc), along with good knowledge in deep learning. I have also worked on various tasks such as creating a whole ML pipeline from scratch and built projects which involve NLP, Time Series Analysis, Computer Vision, and deployment of machine/deep learning models. My educational qualifications include a master's degree in computer science from Blekinge Institute of Technology.
